# Data Sturctures And Algorithms
## Contents
A repository that contains the implementations of major data structures and algorithms in C .
It has two major parts :

  1. Algorithms
  2. Data structures

## Algorithms
Sorting algorithms inlcude : 
  1. Bubble Sort  
  2. Selection Sort   
  3. Insertion Sort   
  4. Merge Sort     
  5. Quick Sort   
  6. Heap Sort  

 Note : Utilities folder contains functions that are used frequently like display an array , swap etc.
